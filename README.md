# TECHM0USE-take-2-
Zombie Shooter style game

Ok, here's the rundown!

First of all, this little game is in very early access. You can expect more features in the coming weeks!

A strange form of life has appeared in the sewers of Amsterdam. A crazy Dutch engineer has captured one of these creatures and manufactured 
a small “mouse robot”, armed with deadly (but small) weapons designed to take out these creatures in one shot. Sadly, he didn’t put enough 
Fracshotnium into the ammunition solution and the weapon isn’t quite as powerful as he’d hoped. 
 
He can control TECHM0USE with a little camera on its front. He uses this to guide TECHM0USE through the sewers (aided by a map in his home 
office) and shoot the strange creatures, with an aim to reduce their reproduction rate until a more permanent solution is found, or in a 
better case scenario, wipe out their entire population. 

At just 22, he became fully qualified engineer, and worked on boats & yachts for a few years until he got made redundant. Desperate to get 
his well-deserved job back, he single-handedly created TECHM0USE after hearing about the strange uprising on an online forum. His entire 
goal is to get recognised by his employer once again. 

Now, You are him in this game, and you get to control TECHM0USE (you lucky duck)! Use WASD or the arrow keys to move around the map. Move 
your mouse to aim at aliens and left click (or hold left click if you're an absolute savage) to shoot.

Good luck kicking some blobby backsides!
